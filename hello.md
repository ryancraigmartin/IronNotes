# Hello

My name is Ryan.

I'm a 24 year old from Miami, Florida.

In 2016 I graduated from Florida International University with a degree in Information Technology.

A few months later in March of 2017, I was hired by the City of Pembroke Pines, Florida as an IT HelpDesk Technician where I worked until March of 2018.

I was a student at IronHack Miami as part of their Full Stack Web Development cohort where I specialized in the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular2, and Node.js)

This repository is a collection of some notes I have taken along my journey from HelpDesk to Web Developer.

Hope you can learn as much as I did while putting these notes together.

Best,
Ryan Craig Martin
