# Angular

Many applications built with Angular are what are called Single Page Applications *(SPA)*.

## What is a Framework?

A software framework is a universal, reusable software environment to facilitate development of software applications, products and solutions. It describes the structure of the application. It gives the developer a way to organize the code to make an app more flexible and scalable. You may know some other frameworks, like Express, a Node.js framework. In this module we will learn a framework for the front-end: Angular.

It may include:

- Support programs.
- Compilers.
- Code libraries.
- Toolsets.
- APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).
- A JavaScript framework is a web application framework written in JavaScript.
