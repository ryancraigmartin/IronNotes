# Extra Notes / Things to Research:

***Properties***: Meta information about the object.

***Methods***: Functions that belong to the object.

**Data Structures:**

- Single and Double LinkLists

- ArrayLists

- Stacks and Queues 

Block vs nested block...

Closures

## Difference between =, ==, & ===

= -  Assignment operator

== & != - Loose/Lenient equality and inequality. Try to convert values of different types before comparing them. (Type coercion)

=== & !== - Strict equality and inequality. Equal value and equal type.
Ex.
``` js
'hello world' === 'hello world'
// true (Both Strings & equal values)

77 === '77'
// false (Number v.s String)
```
