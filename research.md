# Extra Notes / Things to Research:

***Properties***: Meta information about the object.

***Methods***: Functions that belong to the object.

**Data Structures:**

- Single and Double LinkLists

- ArrayLists

- Stacks and Queues 

Block vs nested block...

Closures

## Const & Let

**const** = `Constant` variable. Value *cannot be changed* once defined.

**let** = `Block Scope` variable. Has an even smaller scope than a `var`.
